Keeping track of what I'm learning about on any given day in 2023.

## March 24, 2023
My first task of the day is to spend some time in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).  I'll be spending some time on learning [advanced git/github stuff](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-github-practical-guide/), and getting re-started on the learning for getting my [Azure AZ-900](https://www.udemy.com/course/az900-azure/) certification.  Those are my primary points of attack.  I'll work on some code later for the [Todoist/Twitter social accountability script](https://github.com/dan-bailey/Todoist-Social-Accountability) that I've been needing to wrap-up this month (so I can move on to other things).

Lately, I've been thinking about going after an MBA.  I should.  That will require me to go finish off my BA -- one class -- that I should've done decades ago.
