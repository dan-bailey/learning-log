* Refreshing knowledge via learning-by-doing, working on a client's Wordpress theme.
* Spent some time getting a refresher on Algebra 1 so that I can help my kid with his homework.
  * He's been terrifyingly good at math thus far and will outstrip my abilities in just a couple more years unless I make a concerted effort to catch up with him.
* 

### November 30, 2024
* Need to spend some time exercising the muscles with the `.when()` and `.then()` methods in Javascript.
