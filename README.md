# learning-log
Keeping track of what I'm learning about on any given day in 2023.  You can see my commits and look at my code, but it doesn't give you any sort of context about what I'm actively pursuing.  Hence, this doc.

# the log

## March 24, 2023
My first task of the day is to spend some time in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).  I'll be spending some time on learning [advanced git/github stuff](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-github-practical-guide/), and getting re-started on the learning for getting my [Azure AZ-900](https://www.udemy.com/course/az900-azure/) certification.  Those are my primary points of attack.  I'll work on some code later for the [Todoist/Twitter social accountability script](https://github.com/dan-bailey/Todoist-Social-Accountability) that I've been needing to wrap-up this month (so I can move on to other things).

Lately, I've been thinking about going after an MBA.  I should.  That will require me to go finish off my BA -- one class -- that I should've done decades ago.

I finished the Git & Github course on Udemy yesterday.  Today, I had to work the second job, so I didn't get much coding time in.  Played around with datetime in python a bit...but I'll spend more time on it tomorrow.  I'd like to get this little script I'm working on done before the end of the month.

## March 26, 2023
Had the kiddos today and a bunch of life stuff got in the way.  Spent maybe 10 minutes fucking around with python code.  Did a quick commit to github for the consistency.  Will do better tomorrow.

## March 27, 2023
I took the day off from coding today so I could spend time with the kiddos after work.  I did watch some Udemy videos on Azure AZ-900 certification, though, so the day wasn't completely devoid of learning.

## March 28, 2023
Wasn't as productive as I'd have liked -- I opted to spend more time with the kids and less time working.  Did work through some more training for Azure AZ-900 certification.

## March 29, 2023
Started building out a new plugin for Wordpress (yay, PHP!) to handle the extra content types I want to add to my personal site.  Spent some time in Udemy on the AZ-900 stuff.

## March 30, 2023
More Udemy/AZ-900 stuff today.  Hoping to get that wrapped up by EOD tomorrow.  Got some python code to sling tonight.  I need to buckle down on that.
